/**
 * The seam between the generic cell harness and the domain payload
 * it runs.
 *
 * Harness = this package: the router + auth, the coordinator (dedupe,
 * queue, concurrency, index), the session DO (alarm-per-turn loop,
 * transcript store, WS/poll replay), the pi-agent-core turn runner,
 * and the @criblio/cell-workspace code tools. Payload = what an app
 * plugs in via the DO/router factories (see index.ts): trigger
 * parsing, seeding, domain tools, lifecycle recording. The APM
 * investigator payload lives in criblio/apm (cell/src/payloads/
 * apm.ts); a coding-agent payload is the next consumer.
 *
 * This is the server-side mirror of app-utils' RunLoopOptions — the
 * client agent loop already injects tool definitions, executors, and
 * a context builder; the cell injects the same plus the server-only
 * concerns (triggers, seeds, lifecycle).
